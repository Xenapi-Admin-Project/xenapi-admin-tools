xenapi-admin-tools
==================

Commandline tools to help manage Xen Cloud Platform/Xenserver. See the project page at http://xenapi-admin-project.github.com/xenapi-admin-tools/

Currently the only way of installing xenapi-admin-tools is by using git clone. Install git on your XCP host using this tutorial http://grantmcwilliams.com/item/652-install-git-on-xcp-host.

Clone the repository with this line 

git clone https://github.com/Xenapi-Admin-Project/xenapi-admin-tools.git

In the future I'll have RPM packages for the Yum repository below.

All packages are signed using this [GPG KEY] (https://github.com/Xenapi-Admin-Project/xenapi-admin-tools/blob/master/repo/RPM-GPG-KEY-xap)

To install both the GPG key and the Xenapi Admin Tools repo configuration 

rpm -Uhv <insert package here> # to be updated later.
